This talk explores the world of iterators and iterables in JavaScript -- aka the backbone of the spread/rest operator, generators, and so much more. Attendees will learn more than the basics: custom iterators will be built and modified and weâ€™ll expand our spread operator knowledge with some unusual uses.
