The focus of the presentation will center on the power of numbers to communicate meaning and purpose to people. Through the use of data visualization and storytelling, the presenter will share examples of the ways numbers fill us with hope, change minds, and make us laugh. This is essential for everyone working in tech because our products are only as good as our ability to communicate their value to our stakeholders. When we see our software and databases as repositories of stories that are yet to be told, we find a new appreciation for our products and the people who use them.
