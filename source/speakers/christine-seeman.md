As developers we are always looking at improving and optimizing our workflows, but why don't we also do that with our thoughts? This talk will explore ways to improve those thought processes through looking at techniques like mindfulness, having a growth mindset, implementing new habits like how you do a sprint and even why speed reading might be for you!
