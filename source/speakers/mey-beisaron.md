When was the last time you wrote an algorithm to plan your diet? As programmers we do amazing things in our everyday job, but rarely do we use our knowledge at home. In this talk I will introduce genetic algorithms and share how I coded a genetic algorithm from scratch and used it to generate my weekly schedule and to create a smart diet planer. We will go through the different stages of the algorithm and understand how they affect the algorithmâ€™s solutions. Let me show you a different side of genetic algorithms and you will discover a new way to solve your everyday problems.
