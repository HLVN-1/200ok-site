Over the last few months, I’ve been conducting interviews with some of my heroes. Engineers like Steve Klabnik, Avdi Grimm, Ali Spittel, and Kent C. Dodds who have each built incredible careers in the software industry. The kind of people who never have to deal with something like imposter syndrome, right?

Over the course of dozens of interviews, I have found that every engineer deals with imposter syndrome or at least the occasional feeling of inadequacy. Looking through each of their careers to find strategies to deal with imposter syndrome has incredible value.

By sharing short audio clips from ten+ interviews, I’d like to address two huge issues in our community: imposter syndrome and hero worship.
