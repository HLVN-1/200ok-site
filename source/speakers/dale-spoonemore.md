bio: I've spent most of my 12 years in software thinking of schemes to break things. I've tested applications built using pretty much every language/framework out there across desktop/web/mobile and I currently lead the QA efforts at Surgical Care Affiliates where I spend most of my time writing automated tests for our Angular web apps using Protractor. I'm also an avid gardener/"urban farmer" and I blog about our journey towards growing as much food as possible for our family of 6 at seedtospoon.net
