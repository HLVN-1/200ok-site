## LOGISTICS
We want to make sure you have everything you need to get here and enjoy your time at 200 OK and in Tulsa.

### Airport
Tulsa International Airport (TUL) is our airport if you're flying in.

### Ground Transportation
Uber & Lyft are both available in Tulsa. We also have scooters from Byrd and Lime.

### Hotel
If you're staying in Tulsa, Aloft Tulsa Downtown, Hampton Inn & Suites Tulsa Downtown, and the iconic Tulsa Mayo Hotel are all very close to our venue.

### Parking
Parking at the Central Library's garage is limited, and pricey for all day parking. There are some surrounding lots like the Cox Business Center paid lot. This will probably have more availability and is a short walk to the Library.

### Venue
We are at the [Tulsa Central Library](https://www.tulsalibrary.org/locations/central) in the Pocahontas Greadington Learning and Creativity Center (Lower Level 2).

### Meals
We will provide coffee, snacks, and drinks thru-out the day, and lunch including vegan and gluten-free options (*please mark any restrictions on your ticket registration form).
